# ContactsCRUD-DotNET
My first C# project!  A very basic CRUD to put learning into practice :)

Version 1.0.

I used a real problem where my uncle will rent a garage.
I created a CRUD form to register personal information (name, address, email, phone, etc.) and the respective vehicles (brand, model, license plate) of renters.

I will continue to develop the project! In version 2.0 I will add some masks, exceptions and possibly use a cloud database.

Tools used: Visual Studio, SQL Server.
Language: C#

Special thanks to Professor Alvaro Ciribelli Borges, for the classes taught at Udemy.
